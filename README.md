# JavaScript Prework for AllWomen Bootcamp

The original prework instruction is to recreate the Dog App created by Brian Holt from Frontend Masters (https://frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp/dog-viewer/dog.html)

Having watched a step by step tutorial and replicating the code, I did not find the process to be very educational. <br>
In attempt to get more practice from writing server code, I attempted to recreate the Dog App entirely via backend.

Express was used to create the routes, EJS was used to render the HTML, and the static stylesheet was served up in the public folder.

## Still in progress...
Rendering a spinner while the API retrieves data during POST request.
