# JavaScript Prework for AllWomen Bootcamp

The original prework instruction is to recreate the [Dog App](https://frontendmasters.github.io/bootcamp/dog-viewer/dog.html) created by Brian Holt from Frontend Masters.

Having watched a step by step tutorial and replicating the code, I did not find the process to be very educational. <br>

Even though building it entirely frontend with DOM access was the most straightforward, in order to get more practice from writing server code, I attempted to recreate the Dog App using Express & EJS. 

It is currently hosted locally.

Express was used to create the routes, EJS was used to render the HTML, and the static stylesheet was served up in the public folder.<br>

Two modules, HTTPS (native module) and Axios were used to make the HTTP request in NodeJS because I wanted practice on using different modules.

## Still in progress...
Rendering a spinner while the API retrieves data during POST request.
